/**
 * Read the names of the secrets already set on a Worker.
 *
 * This is the one question `npm run setup` must never get wrong: it decides
 * whether APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY is uploaded again, and uploading a new one orphans
 * every stored provider credential and signs every session out. "I could not
 * read the list" and "there are no secrets" are therefore different answers, and
 * the caller has to treat them differently.
 *
 * Wrangler renamed the output flag: `secret list --json` is a hard error on 4.x
 * ("Unknown argument: json"), while the bare command already prints JSON and
 * `--format json` asks for it explicitly. Spelling this out in one place keeps
 * the setup path, `npm run doctor` and any future caller from each guessing.
 *
 * `readWorkerSecrets` returns:
 *
 *   { ok: true, names: [...] }                 the list was read
 *   { ok: true, names: [], missingWorker: true }  no Worker yet: no secrets
 *   { ok: false, reason }                      unreadable, and it is not that
 *
 * `missingWorker` is matched from wrangler's own message, because the exit code
 * is the same either way.
