/**
 * The login's own rules: what an email address may look like and how long a
 * password has to be.
 *
 * They live here rather than inside a route because the same rules have to hold
 * in two places: the app (Settings → Login, in `api/account`) and the CLI that
 * creates the account (`scripts/lib/account.mjs`). A .mjs script cannot import
 * from src, so that file mirrors these, and a unit test compares the two
 * implementations case by case: a rule can only change in both at once.
 *
 * Delivery is deliberately not checked (no dot required, no DNS): the address
 * is only an identifier, never a place mail is sent.
