 * requests itself, and there is no Durable Object or KV to run. Two things
 * follow from that, and both are deliberate:
 *
 *   * The limits are per Cloudflare location and eventually consistent, so they
 *     are a burst guard rather than an accounting system.
 *   * The in-app lockout (eight failures per fifteen minutes, per account) stays
 *     what actually stops guessing. This keeps a flood from reaching D1 at all,
 *     which is what an unauthenticated PBKDF2 endpoint needs.
